# About

We propose that Noether's theorem is general enough to describe human perception, extending its applications beyond Physics to Cognitive Sciences, and potentially unifying the branches of Natural Sciences. 

We invite interdisciplinary discussions to from an eclectic view on perception. We start off the conversation by framing our exploration in terms of perceptual constancy, welcoming discussions which adopted other phenomena as test beds. We also included intuitive interpretations and step-by-step introduction to Noether's theorem to make it easy for interested individuals to join the dialogue.

This website collects thoughts and ideas, both developed or neonate, on formalizing perception using Noether's theorem. It offers introduction to the topic, featuring explanations suitable for readers of all levels. It draws parallels across disciplines, translating terminologies and highlighting equivalences.
