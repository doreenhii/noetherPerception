    <h4>What is perception</h4>
</header>
Perception is the mental representation of physical properties. Perception is often classified as a low level cognitive function, but it is by no means easy! Common synonyms to perception include: mind, mental model, subjective experience, ... Therefore, research using any of those keywords are to our interest. Specifically, we ask: what is the governing law of perception?

    <h4>Perceptual constancies in everyday life</h4>
</header>
Why did we choose the phenomena of perceptual constancy as our test vehicles? In our opinion, perceptual constancy offers the best setup to study the intrinsic laws of perception. As shown in <a href="noetherTheorem.html">Noether's theorem</a> page, Noether's theorem is a theorem that has been widely used to reveal the hidden laws of nature (the conservation laws). To apply Noether's theorem in our research, we need to define symmetries based on our observations. These symmetries are nothing else than invariances or constancies which we experience in our daily lives. Another way of viewing perceptual constancy is that there are some transformations that humans are robust to, such that the arrived perception remains constant before and after the transformation. 

An short list of visual perceptual constancy is included below. The more we can expand on this list, the more perspectives we can take on. 
- Shape constancy: the ability to label the shape as rectangular whether it is shown upright on a computer screen or lying flat on a table, slanted in depth
- Size constancy: the ability to attribute consistent size to the book regardless is placed on a table 2m away or held in hands .5m away
- Lightness constancy: the ability to distinguish a white object placed in a dark room as white while a black object placed under sunlight is black although the absolute light reflectance may not indicate so
- Color constancy: the ability to interpret a car as having the blue color whether it is parked under sunlight or moonlight
- Object constancy: the ability to tell that the car you saw in the side mirror is now the car in front of you

	<h4>Our stance</h4>
</header>

Our journey started with observation on invariance (symmetry) regarding some aspects of the world. We are inspired by the phenomena under the umbrella term: perceptual constancy where some physical quantities are always perceived consistently regardless of time, space or other transformations.

We focus on visual perception since it is the most dominant sensory perception in most cases for humans. Not only so, we have the deepest understanding in vision compared to other sensory modalities. 

In this project we will focus on 3D shape constancy. Why 3D shapes instead of simpler 2D shapes? We argue that human vision operates in 3D, with 2D shapes being a subset of all perceivable shapes. Not only so, 2D shapes are perceived by solving the visual problem in 3D, as the Shepherd table illusion suggests \["Turning the Tables" Shepard, R. N. (1990). Mind sights: Original visual illusions, ambiguities, and other anomalies, with a commentary on the play of mind in perception and art. WH Freeman/Times Books/Henry Holt & Co\]. 

However, 3D shape perception is an ill-posed inverse problem because human retina represents information only in 2D. To arrive at a unique perception at a higher dimension (3D) scene given a lower dimension 2D retinal image, human visual algorithm needs to select out of infinitely many possibilities, the one perception to arrive at. Not only so, all humans see things the same way, suggesting that all humans picked the same perceptual solution to arrive at out of the infinite choices. There must be a law in nature that governs this process. 

The goal of this project is to identify the underlying law that allowed 3D shape perception to occur, a law general enough that all humans would arrive at the same perception. We believe we have the best chance of studying this law by following Noether's formulation: every invariance in nature is related to its conservation law through the least action principle. Refer to the <a href="brainstorm.html">Attempts</a> page for full details on our proposal, where we discuss the direction of research towards the identification of the conservation law for visual perception.

    <h4>Sidetrack: Impressive perceptual constancy</h4>
</header>
Perceptual constancy is impressive given that the physical system supporting and maintaining the constancy is dynamic and noisy &#8212; hundred thousand neurons die everyday and the brain is noisy. This is equivalent to training a neural net, applying dropout not only during training (i.e. accounting for apoptosis during learning) but also dropout during testing (i.e. accounting for dynamic changes when confronted with a problem). Of course, we are constantly learning and adjusting, so this may not be an apt example but to get the point across, it is really impressive.
